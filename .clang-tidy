# Globally Disabled checks:
#
# bugprone-easily-swappable-parameters: This warning is loud with no clear advice on how to fix the potential problem
# bugprone-reserved-identifier: LibC headers that show up in the header filter are part of "the implementation"
#   cert-dcl37-c: Alias for bugprone-reserved-identifier
#   cert-dcl51-cpp: Alias for bugprone-reserved-identifier
# cert-dcl21-cpp: No reference to this rule exists on Carnegie Mellon's SEI CERT C++ Confluence. And the suggestion is unusual
# cert-err58-cpp: Complains about exceptions thrown from static initializers. We don't use exceptions.
# misc-no-recursion: The project uses recursive algorithms in several places.
# misc-include-cleaner: This check is nice for cleanliness, but is very very noisy
# FIXME: misc-non-private-member-variables-in-classes: Audit uses of protected member variables to see if they really need to be protected
# performance-noexcept-move-constructor: The project does not use exceptions, so there are no such optimizations available
# performance-no-int-to-ptr: This rule flags every pointer to integer cast, which gets quite noisy. Should only be enabled on a case-by-case basis
# portability-avoid-pragma-once: #pragma once is fine
# readability-braces-around-statements: Redundant braces around single-line conditions is against project style
# readability-function-cognitive-complexity: Most regular contributors seem to turn this one off anyway. Violations are hard to fix as well
# readability-magic-numbers: This check is very noisy in the codebase, especially in AK.
# readability-named-parameter: We frequently omit parameter names to work around -Wunused-parameter
