MASSAGING THINGS INTO A WORKABLE STATE:
- Be able to reload assets during runtime! This is important.
	- BUG: font texture filenames are put in temp memory, which gets thrown away before they
		are even used! It's a bug that we can actually read the filenames AT ALL.
		We either need to make the AssetManager forget those textures until the font loads
		them again, or keep the filenames around. Probably both actually.

- Get rid of BitmapFontCache. It's too restrictive.
- Load ui theme from a file
- Load texture region information from a file
- Handle cursors ourselves? Not sure about latency.
- Check for the flicker bug while we have so few things being drawn.
- Game produces list of abstract draw instructions, then passed to the renderer
	- Generic "Renderer" struct, extended by each platform?
- Asset system dynamic allocations. e.g. So we don't have to predetermine number of texture regions.
- Is RenderArena used?
- Is temporary memory in renderer init used?

- Use several arenas, not just all sub-arenas
- Stretchy arenas

GAME:
- Draw a map
- Draw a grid over it
- Create pipes
- They link

BUGS:
- Flickering of some things. Not sure if the sorter might be off-by-one?
- Unloading Fraps does something funny with our Window reference, causing a crash.

Rendering 2.0:
- Stop passing a size to drawSprite()! Will always draw at a consistent size.
- At some point, need to distinguish between "flat" sprites (e.g. field)  and "tall" ones (e.g. barn, farmhouse, farmer).
- Draw things with an offset, defined per-texture-region(?)
- Flash funds label when it changes
- Probably replace the binary search for glyphs with something better?

Asset packing:
- Pack asset PNGs into a set of standard-sized ones, with 1 px of padding around them
	for the bilinear filtering
- Store TextureRegion information in a little binary file
- Read data from these rather than hard-coded filenames


ENGINE:
- Audio!
	- Sound effects
	- Pitch shifting
	- Music
- An actual random number generator!
- Temporary memory automatically closes when it leaves scope?
- Scenarios
	- A background image, a size, etc.

BUILD:

For future reference, here's the build system config for sublime text 3:
{
	"shell_cmd": "build.bat",
	"working_dir": "${file_path}",
	"file_regex": "^(...*?)[(]([0-9]*)[)]",
	"shell": true,
	"encoding": "gb2312"
}
Took me WAY TOO LONG to make that work.
