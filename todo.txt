BUGS:
- When demolishing barns, workers en route sometimes lose their potato?
- Flickering of some things. Not sure if the sorter might be off-by-one?
- Unloading Fraps does something funny with our Window reference, causing a crash.

Rendering 2.0:
- Stop passing a size to drawSprite()! Will always draw at a consistent size.
- At some point, need to distinguish between "flat" sprites (e.g. field)  and "tall" ones (e.g. barn, farmhouse, farmer).
- Replace 'isUI' nonsense with something better?
- Draw things with an offset, defined per-texture-region(?)
- Flash funds label when it changes
- Fade-out the message popup
- Shader-loading function!
- Show Â£ signs! Something is borked.
- Probably replace the binary search for glyphs with something better?

Asset packing:
- Pack asset PNGs into a set of standard-sized ones, with 1 px of padding around them
	for the bilinear filtering
- Store TextureRegion information in a little binary file
- Read data from these rather than hard-coded filenames

Immediate Mode UI:
- Generally, things will be much simpler.
- Label
- Text alignment
- Tooltip
- UI Message
- Button
- Button group!
- Text Input
- Menu (Click, it pops up)
- Buttons eat mouse input?

- Simulation
	- Per-tile humidity
	- Per-tile nutrient value
	- Grass grows naturally, is destroyed by animals and heavy foot traffic

-AI
	- Only take jobs that can be accomplished
	- Prioritise jobs that are closer/easier

- Pathfinding!
	- Movement speeds per tile?
	- Use a more intelligent flood-fill algorithm? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected-component_labeling

- Scenarios?
	- System for loading a level
	- Load a pre-built farm on game start
	- Have multiple different ones? 

- Different crops!
	- Worth different amounts
	- Different growth speed
	- Grow at different times of year?
	- Different graphics

- Random events
	- Frost!
	- Heatwave!
	- Bugs!
	- Disease!
	- Machinery breaks!

- Farm machinery
	- Each can only do one task at a time
	- Machinery speeds-up task time
	- Several ranks of machinery
	- Tractor
	- Combine Harvester

- Field maintenance
	- Fertilizer / Manure

- Buildings as zones
	- Drag a rectangle of 'field' to determine its size
	- Can erase part of a zoned building
	- Can add to a zoned building

- Weather!
	- Wetness and temperature based on time of year
	- Wet/dryness affects plant growth
	- Can water fields when it's dry

- An actual random number generator!
