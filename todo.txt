TODO:

BUGS:
- When demolishing barns, workers en route sometimes lose their potato?
- Flickering of some things. Not sure if the sorter might be off-by-one?

Rendering 2.0:
- Stop passing a size to drawSprite()! Will always draw at a consistent size.
- At some point, need to distinguish between "flat" sprites (e.g. field)  and "tall" ones (e.g. barn, farmhouse, farmer).
- Replace 'isUI' nonsense with something better?
- Draw things with an offset, defined per-texture-region(?)
- Flash funds label when it changes
- Fade-out the message popup
- Stop using SDL_Color, and instead just use V4?

Asset packing:
- Pack asset PNGs into a set of standard-sized ones, with 1 px of padding around them
	for the bilinear filtering
- Store TextureRegion information in a little binary file
- Read data from these rather than hard-coded filenames

Immediate Mode UI:
- No more BitmapFontCachedText and its related memory allocation!
- Generally, things will be much simpler.

- Simulation
	- Per-tile humidity
	- Per-tile nutrient value
	- Grass grows naturally, is destroyed by animals and heavy foot traffic

- Pathfinding!
	- Whether each tile is pathable
	- Movement speeds per tile
	- Rimworld-style 'zones' to establish which areas are inaccessible

- Scenarios?
	- System for loading a level
	- Load a pre-built farm on game start
	- Have multiple different ones? 

- Different crops!
	- Worth different amounts
	- Different growth speed
	- Grow at different times of year?
	- Different graphics

- Random events
	- Frost!
	- Heatwave!
	- Bugs!
	- Disease!
	- Machinery breaks!

- Farm machinery
	- Each can only do one task at a time
	- Machinery speeds-up task time
	- Several ranks of machinery
	- Tractor
	- Combine Harvester

- Field maintenance
	- Fertilizer / Manure
	- 

- Weather!
	- Wetness and temperature based on time of year
	- Wet/dryness affects plant growth
	- Can water fields when it's dry

- An actual random number generator!
