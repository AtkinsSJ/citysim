# CitySim

A city simulation game I've tinkered with on-and-off since 2015.

## Windows

On Windows, run `./build.bat` and hopefully it works! Then run it with `./build/citysim.exe`.

## Linux

On Linux, run `./build.sh`, after installing the required libraries:
- SDL2
- SDL2_image
- GLEW

You'll also need Clang, until I make it use your preferred C++ compiler.

Eventually I'll use a proper build system, maybe...

Then run it with `./build/citysim`.
